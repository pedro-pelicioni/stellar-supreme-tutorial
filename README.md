![Stellar Supreme Tutorial Banner](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f5z4x9h3j0q6z8gvi2al.png)

## 🌟 Introduction

Hey Stellar community! I'm thrilled to share my project for the Build Better on Stellar: Smart Contract Challenge. Introducing **Stellar Supreme Tutorial** - a interactive learning experience for Soroban smart contracts!

## 🚀 Project Overview

Stellar Supreme Tutorial is an interactive, browser-based learning platform designed to guide developers through the intricacies of Soroban smart contracts. Inspired by the Tour of Rust and Soroban Quest, this project aims to make the learning process more engaging and hands-on.

### Key Features:

1. **Interactive Lessons**: Step-by-step tutorials covering Soroban basics to advanced concepts.
2. **In-Browser Playground**: Write and test Soroban code directly in your browser.
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation of your code as you progress through lessons.
4. **Progressive Learning Path**: Structured modules that build upon each other for a comprehensive understanding.

## 💡 The Spark of Inspiration

I entered this hackathon primarily to learn, but I'm walking away with incredible ideas to contribute to the Stellar ecosystem. This MVP is just the beginning!

The project drew inspiration from various sources:

- **Tour of Rust**: For its intuitive, step-by-step learning approach.
- **Soroban Quest**: For its gamified take on blockchain education.
- **CryptoZombies**: For its interactive, project-based learning style.
- **Alchemy University**: For its comprehensive curriculum and NFT-based achievements.

## 🔮 Future Vision

While this MVP is a basic implementation due to time constraints, it has ignited a passion to create something truly impactful for the Stellar community. Here's what's on the horizon:

1. **Integration with Okashi.dev**: Generate NFTs as proof of completion for different learning milestones.
2. **RPC Siege Integration**: Bring RPC Siege to life in a more practical way, potentially using gitpod.io.
3. **Comprehensive Curriculum**: Expand the tutorial to cover a wide range of Stellar and Soroban topics.
4. **Interactive Challenges**: Implement coding challenges that mimic real-world scenarios.

## 🌈 The Stellar Community

I've been overwhelmed by the warm welcome from the Stellar community. Your support and enthusiasm have been incredible, and I'm committed to giving back in the best way I know how - by creating educational resources that empower more developers to build on Stellar.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend
- Soroban SDK for smart contract examples
- Custom JavaScript for the interactive code editor and lesson progression

## 🎨 Design

The project uses a clean, accessible design with the Stellar color palette:

- Generous Gold: #FDDA24 
- Black: #0F0F0F 
- White: #F6F7F8 

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to the Stellar Development Foundation for organizing this hackathon and to the entire Stellar community for their support and resources.
